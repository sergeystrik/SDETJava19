Type casting is moving the data from one data type to another.
When we move something from a small data type to a large data type it's called
auto/widening/implicit.
When we move something from a bigger box to a smaller box it is called manual/narrowing/explicit.
  When should we use type casting?

When we combine the code from different sources we might need to perform this type casting to make the code compatible.

   Relational operators:
     Relational operators help us compare data.They always return results in true or false.

    ==if something is same or not - return true
    !=if something is not same - return true
    > if the value on the left is greater than right - return true
    < if the value on the left is smaller than right - return true
    >=if the value on the left is greater or equal than right - return true
    <= if the value on the left is smaller or equal than right - return true

If Statements:
  If Statements help us execute the code conditionally.
  Without if conditions all the programs will be useless.They will not be able to take any decisions.
  There are many variations of these  statements.
  if statements.
  if else
  else if
  Nested if statements:
   if statements.
     one condition one action.
     if else
     one condition two actions.
     if else if statement
     multiple cond multiple actions
     Nested if:
      When one condition is depended on another condition
      that's when we use nested if statement
