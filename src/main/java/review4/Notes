Loops help us repeat a block of code
until and condition fails.There are 4 main types of loops in Java.
1) While loop
2) Do While loop
3) For loop
4) Enhanced for loops
While loop:
When we don't know the number of iterations be performed
while loop is the best type of loop to use in that scenario.
Example we are searching for the product on amazon we keep clicking
the next button until we find it.
Do while loop:
When we want to execute the loop at least once
before we check the condition when we ll be using
For-used in situation  when we know quantity in advance(example 10 times)
