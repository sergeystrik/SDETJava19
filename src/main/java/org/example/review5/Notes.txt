Nested Loops:
    A loop inside another loop is called a nested loop.
    We can Nest any loop inside any other loop.
Why should we learn about Nested Loops:
    WE need Nested loops to go through multiple levels
    of data, for example, we might want to go through the main
    categories of items, and we might want to go through individual items
    in each list.
    We also need Nested loops to process data which have multiple levels
    like a 2D array or an Excel sheet.
2D Arrays:
    2D array is basically a collection of multiple 1d Arrays.
Why should we learn about 2D arrays:
    When we want to process the information which is present in the form of
    rows and columns, we will be using the 2D arrays.
OOPS:
    It is just a way of writing code.
Why should we learn about OOPS?
    It helps us write large amounts of code easily.
Class:
    A Class represents a group of entities with similar attributes and behaviors.
