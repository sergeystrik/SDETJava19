Constructors:
  Constructors help us build the objects of a class easily.
  When we build the objects most of the time, it means we
   are initializing the instance variables.
Why should we use constructors?
  1)Its more readable,neat and clean.
  2)its more secure.

 Rules:
  1) Constructors do not have return types not even void.
  2) Constructors have same name as class name.
  3) Constructors can have parameters like methods.
  4) We can use access modifiers as well with constructors.
