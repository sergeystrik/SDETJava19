Types of variables:
 There are 3 types of variables.
 1) Local
 2) Instance
 3) Static/Class Variables

Local Variables:
  Those Variables which are created inside a block of code are called local variables,
  for example, all the variables that we create inside the loops,if else statements,
  methods,switch statements they all called local variables
Upside:
  They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time.
Downside:
  They can only accessed inside the block of code where they are created.


Instance Variables:
  The variables which are created outside of blocks of code but inside a class are called instance
  variables
Upside:
  These variables can be used anywhere inside the class.
Downside:
   They keep on occupying the memory even if you are done using them.
When should we use instance variables:
  1)When we want to share a variable with all of the instance methods of a class.
  2) When you are planning to create multiple objects of a class, and yoU know that every obj is going to have
   different value.


Static Variables:
   Static variables have static keyword
 Upside:
   Highest visibility can be accessed inside the class in any block of code can be accessed in
   static or non-static methods.Can be accessed outside of class if coupled with a proper access
   modifier.
Downside:
    They occupy the memory for longest.
