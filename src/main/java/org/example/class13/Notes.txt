Methods in java:
    Methods are block of code that do something when we call them.
    They can take input(arguments/parameters) and they can also
    return data back.
Why should we use methods?
    Methods help us save code repetition in multiple classes.
Syntax Of Method:
    return Type nameOfMethod(Parameters){

    }

    void add(int a,int b){
    souta+b;
    }
