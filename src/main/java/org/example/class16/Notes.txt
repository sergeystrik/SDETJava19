Constructors:
    Constructors help us build the object of a class easily.
    When we build the object most of the time, it means we are
    initializing the instance variables.
Why should we use constructors?
        1) Its more readable, neat and clean.
        2) Its more secure.

Rules:
    1) Constructors do not have return types not even void.
    2) Constructors have the same name as class name.
    3) Constructors can have parameters like methods.
    4) We can use access modifiers as well with Constructors.
