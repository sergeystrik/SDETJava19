Collections framework:
   Collections framework is a collection of classes and
   interfaces which helps us store large amounts of data
   easily.
Why do we need a Collections framework?
    1) Arrays are fixed in size
    2) There are no built-in methods in arrays to manipulate the
    data.
Note:
    1)Arrays are very efficient ArrayList requires at least 4 times the
    memory of an array to store the same amount of data.
    2) They offer the fastest processing.
    3) ArrayList is also built using arrays internally.
