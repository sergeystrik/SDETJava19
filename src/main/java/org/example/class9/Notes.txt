Arrays:
    Arrays are collections of multiple variables.
    These variables have indexes which help us retrieve
    and store data inside the array.
Why should we use Arrays:
    When we have a lot of data storing it inside variables is not
    feasible.
Syntax:
    Approach 1
    Datatype [] ArrayName= new DataType[Size];
    int [] numbers=new int[5];
    Approach 2:
    Datatype [] ArrayName={ element1,element2,element2,element2};
    int [] numbers={10,20,30,45,50};
Enhanced for loop:
    Enhanced for loop is a simplified version of normal
    for loop where the elements are pulled from the array
    automatically one by one. There is no index involved in
    this type of loop.
Nested Loops:
    Nested Loop is a loop inside another loop.
Why do we need Nested Loops?
