List:
    1) Insertion order is maintained.

ArrayList:
    UpSide: Very Fast when accessing the elements.
    Downside: Really slow when we have to add or remove data from the ArrayList
LinkedList:
    Upside: Really Fast when we have to add or remove data from the List.
    DownSide: Very Slow when accessing the elements.
Set:
    1) They don't allow duplicates.
    2) They don't store the data based on index.
HashSet:
    Upside:
        It's Fast.
    Downside:
        It does not remember the insertion order.
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside:
        it remembers the order.
    Downside:
        It's a little slower than the HashSet.
TreeSet:

        It keeps the data sorted.
    Downside:
        Insertion is very, very slow.
