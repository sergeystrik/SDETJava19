Type casting:
    Type casting is moving the data from
    one data type to another. When we move
    something from a small data type to a
    large data type it's called auto/widening/implicit.
    When we move something from a bigger
    box to a smaller box it is called Manual/narrowing/explicit.
Data Types from smaller to large:
    1)byte
    2)short
    3)int
    4)long
    5)float
    6)double
When should we use type casting?
     When we combine the code from different sources we might
     need to perform this type casting to make the code
     compatible.
Relational operators:
    Relational operators help us compare data. They always return the
    results in the form of either a true or false.
    == if something is same returns true
    != if something is not same returns true
    > if the value on left side is greater than right side returns true
    < if the value on left side is smaller than right side returns true
    >= if the value on left side is greater or equal than right side returns true
    <= if the value on left side is smaller or equal than right side returns true

If Statements:
    If Statements help the computer to execute the code conditionally.
    Without if conditions almost all the programs will be useless. They will not
    be able to take any decisions.
    There are many variations of these statements.
    if statements.
    if else statements
    else if statements
    Nested if statements

if statements.
    one condition one action.
if else statements.
        one condition two actions.
if else if statements.
        multiple conditions multiple actions.
Nested if:
    When one condition is dependent on another condition
    that's when we use nested if statements.
