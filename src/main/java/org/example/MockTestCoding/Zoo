In this implementation:

We define an AnimalBehavior interface with methods eat(), sleep(), and makeSound().
We create an abstract class Animal that implements AnimalBehavior and defines properties like name and age.
It also declares an abstract method displayInformation() for showing details about the animal.
The Mammal and Bird classes extend Animal and implement specific behaviors for mammals and birds, respectively.
 They override methods like eat(), sleep(), and makeSound().
We demonstrate polymorphism and method overriding by creating instances of Mammal and Bird and calling the behavior
 methods on them.
The displayInformation() method displays information about each animal, showcasing data encapsulation and abstraction.
