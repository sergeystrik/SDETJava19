Types of Variables:
     There are three types of variables.
     1) Local
     2) Instance
     3) Static/Class Variables
Local Variables:
    Those Variables which are created inside a block of code
    are called local variables, for example, all the variables that we
    create inside loops, if else statements, methods, switch statements
    they are all called as local variables.
Upside:
    They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time.
Downside:
    They can only be accessed inside the block of code where they are
    created.
when to use local variables:
    Always try to use local variables.
Instance Variables:
    The variables which are created outside of blocks of code but inside
    a class are called instance variables.
Upside:
    These variables can be used anywhere inside the class except static methods.
Downside:
    They keep on occupying the memory even if you are done using them.
When should we use instanced variables?
    1) When we want to share a variable with all the instance methods of
    a class.
    2) When you are planning to create multiple objects of a class, and you
    know that every object is going to have a different value, then you can
    also use instance variables.

Static Variables:
    Static variables have the static keyword before them.
Upside:
    Highest visibility can be accessed inside the class in any block of
    code can be accessed in static or non-static methods. Can be accessed
    outside of class if coupled with a proper access modifier.
Downside:
    They occupy the memory for longest.
When should we use static variables?
    When we want to share something with all
    the objects or the information that stays
    the same for all the objects, we should store
    it in static variables.
