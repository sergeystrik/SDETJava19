Super Keyword:
    Super keyword is used to explicitly refer to the instance variables
    from the parent class. It is also used to call the constructor from
    the parent class.

How Inheritance?
    Whenever we use Inheritance, the objects of the parent classes
    are created first.
    If we do not create any constructor, java creates the default
    ones. It uses these default constructors to create these
    objects, however, when we create our own constructor, then java
    is not going to do this for us, and we have to do this ourselves.
Method Overloading:
    Method overloading allows us to have multiple methods with the same
    name inside a class.
Why should we Overload?
    It gives more flexibility to users. Users don't need to memorize a
     lot of different method names.
