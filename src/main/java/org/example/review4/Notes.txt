Loops:
    Loops help us repeat a block of code until and condition
    fails. There are 4 main types of loops in java.
    1) While loop
    2) Do While Loop
    3) For loop
    4) Enhanced for Loops
While loop:
    When we don't know the number of iterations beforehand
    while loop is the best type of loop to use in that scenario.
    For example when we are searching for a product from amazon
    we keep on clicking the next button until we find it.
Do While loop:
    When we want to execute the body of the loop at least once before
    we check the condition that's when we should be using the do while
    loop.
For:
    For is a better choice when we know the number of iterations in advance.
    for example, we want to print the 10 numbers.
Array:
    Array is a collection of multiple variables. Every variable is given
    a number called as index that we can use to access that variable.
