Break keyword:
    Break keyword breaks the loop. We always use Break keyword
    with if conditions once the condition is met it stops the
    loop even if there are still iterations remaining.
Why should we use Break:
    If we ue Break we can save a lot of unnecessary processing
    by terminating the loop once the goal is complete.
Continue:
    Continue keyword is used to skip unnecessary calculations.
    if an element meets a condition that element is skipped and
    we move to the next element.
Why should we use?
    To save resources to avid unnecessary calculations.
Note:
    Break and continue keyword are always written with if
    conditions inside the loop.
2D Arrays:
    2D array is simply multiple one d arrays combined together in the
    for of rows and columns. To pull or store information in a
    2D array we use two indexes one to specify the row and other
    to specify the column.
