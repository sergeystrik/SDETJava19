Exception:
    1) These are types of errors that we face while programming.
    They happen at run time when computer can't do a task
    because we are asking the computer to do something that
    is not possible, or it does not have the resources.
    2) It's an unwanted event that happens at runtime. it
    disrupts the normal flow of the programs.
Why:
    These types of issues are very expensive to fix.
How to Fix/Avoid Exceptions:
    We can avoid these exceptions by using the try catch block.
Types of Exceptions:
    Exception has two main types checked and non-checked.
    Checked Exception:
        These important exceptions which must be handled with try catch
        blocks. Java is going to give us error if we don't.
    Non-Checked:
        These are not very important. They can be avoided
        without try catch block.
