What is OOPs(Object Oriented Programming):
    It is just a way of writing code. Just like, we have many
    techniques of fighting like (Kung Fu etc). we also have
    many techniques to write large amounts of code.
Why should we learn OOPs?
    1) It Helps us reduce the code duplications.
    2) It helps us write dynamic code(Same code doing different things).
    3) It helps us write Modular code.
    4) It helps us write secure code.
Class:
    A Class represents objects which have similar properties
    and behaviors. We use these classes to create things quickly and efficiently.
    It's like a design/blueprint that helps us build objects quickly.
