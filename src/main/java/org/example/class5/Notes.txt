Scanner class:
    Scanner is a class that helps us take input data from the
    user from keyboard. Just like scanner class we have so many other
    classes that we can use from Java and other libraries.
    These classes are divided into methods each method can do something
    useful. Like nextInt(), nextBoolean(), nextDouble().

Logical operators:
    Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions. There are
    three logical operators in java.
    1) Logical NOT "!"
    2) Logical OR "||"
    3) Logical AND "&&"
switch statements:


Important Note:
    Every class in java also acts as a data type. We can
    crate variables of these classes.
    If we want to reuse some codes from a class. we can
    create its objects and then we can start calling those
    methods.
