difference between print and println.
What are variables?
    Variables are like containers that we use to store
    data in our programs.
What are DataTypes?
    DataTypes are used to store/identify different type of
    data in variables.
Primitive dataTypes:
    There are eight basic data types in java.
    byte => the extra small whole number box
    short => the small whole number box
    int => medium
    long => extra large
    float=> small container for decimal numbers
    double => medium container for decimal numbers
    char=> smallest datatype for storing the characters.
    boolean=> store true or false
non-primitive dataTypes.
    Are advance data types built using the above mentioned 8 primitive
    data types.
=============================================================
How do we decide what data type we should use for a variable?
    We decide based on two things one is what type of data we are planing to store
    and second what type of operations we will be performing on that data.
What are naming conventions in java:
    1) For variables we use camelCase
    2) For class names we use PascalCase
    3) For packages they are always in lowercase.
String concatenation:
    String concatenation allows us to join two strings together.
Arithmetic operators:
 Are simply these symbols that we can use to perform simple math operation + - / * %.
