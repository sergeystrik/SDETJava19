Scanner Class in java:
    Scanner is a class just like the classes that we create.
    but it is specially designed so that others can use it.
    This class has a lot of methods which can help us take the
    input from the keyboard.

 Logical Operators:
    Logical operators help us combine multiple conditions. There are 3 logical operators
    in java.
    NOT(!)
    OR(||)
    AND(&&)
NOT(!):
    Reverses the conditions if something is true it will make it false if something is
    false it will make it true.
OR(||):
    Logical Or helps us to combine multiple boolean conditions in a way that when one condition
    is true the overall result is a true.
AND(&&):
    Logical AND Helps us combine the conditions in a way that we only get an overall true when
    all the conditions are true.

Loop:
    Loops help us repeat a block of code as long as  the condition is true. We have while do while and
    we have for loop.
Why should we use loops:
    Loops help us reduce duplicate code.
When we should use the while loop:
    When we don't know the number of iterations in advance its better we use while loop.
    For loop is better when we know the number of iterations in advance.


when should we use switch statements:
we should  use switch when we are  checking the same variable
against multiple values and for each value we want to do something different.
